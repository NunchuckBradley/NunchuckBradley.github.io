# Welcome to Martin's website

My website/weblog where I put anything I want on it!

<br>

I am a software developer who mainly focuses on websites using Drupal and PHP.
Am able to maintain some servers, but still have tonnes to learn about.
Always want to learn, but usually the interesting bits [üòè](https://emojipedia.org/smirking-face/)

So, I will put and ideas, thoughts, achievments or any 'interests' on here.

<br>
This site is made using GitHub pages, Jakyll and Markdown as the content files. New tech for me (as of 17.Feb.2022).
