`Hyundai Coupe SE 2.0 16v 2006`

This is the first vehicle I have owned. Baught in 2020 with minimal inspection as my knowledge was small.
Excluding that, after a clean, was nice and tidy. Everything *seemed* to be working as expected.

<br>

A nice vehicle to drive.
- Nice and low, heavy stearing. So handles well around corners.
- Acceleration is decent. Not extreme, but fast enough for my first vehicle.
- Comfortable. Despite it being low and suspension being stiff/a little broken, it is very comfy.
- Luggage room. As a coupe sports car, you might expect small boot/passeneger space, but there is enough for even a push bike to fit without removing the wheels!

Gripes üôÅ
- Exceptionally large doors! You need lots of space, or flexibility to get into even an average gap.
- It being a "2+2", the seats in the back work, but they are pathetic with head room, so only children or REALLY small adults can fit.

Has plently of rust underneath, luckily only seems to be surface.
Lots of dark solid and sticky goop in the engine oil fillup area, really risking damage to the whole engine, but hasnt given any issues related to it since (18.Feb.2022).
Had an oil change year later since purchase, and there was alot of nasty, clumped up bits. Quite shocking to see.

Maybe there hasnt been any problems due to the size? Maybe the size allows the 'destruction' or removal of any small bits which may get into it?

And so, the series of problems doesnt stop there. View the posts for me specific details.
